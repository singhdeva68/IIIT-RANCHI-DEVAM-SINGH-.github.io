    <h1>               Expectation vs Reality of College</h1>
    <h3>College gives us so many memories and achievements in our life specailly in B.tech where we get much things to learn either academic or skill development.
        But when our mind creates a image of our college before getting into campus, such things happened with me also. So I would like to share my review on "Expectaion VS Reality" for my college.

    <h1> COURSE</h1>
    <h2><em>Expectation</em></h2>
    <div class="box" align="right"><img src="c.png " height="300" width="600" ></div>
    <div class="box" align="left"><img src="difp.png " ></div>
    
    <p>It was expected that the course will not be too much heptic and we will be getting enough time to explore our surroundings. I thought that i would be learnng basics of c,c++,java in my first semester.</p>
    
    <h2><em>Reality</em></h2>
    <p>Actually, we study many subjects other than Computer Programming like Electronics, Professional Communication, Electical Technology and Engineering Physics also in some sections for the first year, we also have to do lot of assignments in different subjects.</p>
    
    <h1>ROOM SIZE</h1>
    
    <h2><em>Expectation</em></h2>
    <div class="pic" align="left"><img src="hos1.jpeg" height="300" width="400"></div>
    <p>We thought that as usual like other hostels we would be soffacting with 3 or 4 students in a single room with low space but we suppoesed that we would be getting almirah for stroring our clothes.
        Also it was supposed that we have to clean our rooms particularly.
    </p>
    
    <h2><em>Reality</em></h2>
    <div class="pic" align="right"><img src="hos2.jpeg" height="300" width="500"></div>
    <p>It was good to know after coming her that only 2 students will be here in a single room and rooms will be cleaned by 2nd or 3rd day by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housekeeper_(domestic_worker)">housekeepers</a>. Also we got quite space in our rooms but here is no almirah.
    </p>
     
    <h1>FACULTIES</h1>

    <h2><em>Expectation</em></h2>
    <p>We thought as like other colleges our faculties will be so strict and not such co-operative. We imagined something like it would be tougher side for us to cope up with them in studies. </p>
     
    <h2><em>Reality</em></h2>
    <p> But in reality situations are different, faculties are so much helpful. They just not clear our doubts also they themselves teaches us in such an effective manner that our most of doubts could be clear easily. </p>

    <h1>WIFI SPEED</h1>
    <div class="pic" align="middle"><img src="wifi.jpeg" height="300" width="400" height="300" width="450"></div>
    <h2><em>Expectation</em></h2>
    <P>I thought that the wifi internet speed would be good enough to handle the workloads as well as our personal needs related to music and gaming as well as movies in weekends. </P>

    <h2><em>Reality</em></h2>
    <p>Wifi speed is not that bad but it sometimes not capable to handle 8 persons internet needs at a time and also watching youtube videos <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/buffer">buffers</a> usually and gaming with this internet speed is nearly impossible. </p>
     
    <h1>GENDER RATIO</h1>
    <h2><em>Expectation</em></h2>
    <div class="pic" align="middle"><img src="gb.jpg" height="500" width="900" ></div>
    <p>I got to know from youtube that the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gender-ratio#:~:text=The%20sex%20ratio%20at%20birth%20is%20not%20equal%3A%20in%20every,around%20103%20to%20107%20boys).">gender ratio</a> for Boys to Girls is 5:1 </p>
    <h><em>After getting admission here I realized that the reality was totaly differenet and Boys to Girls ratio is 22:1</em></h>

    <h1>CURFEW TIME</h1>
    <h2><em><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/curfew">Curfew</a> time is that which was expected, for campus gate it is 9 PM and for Hostel Building it is 10 PM</em></h2>
    <h1>OUR MESS</h1>
    <h2><em>Expectation</em></h2>

    I expected that like any other government college's mess, it will be also providing very simple and boring food.
    I thought that quality will be compromised and timing will be shorter and also crowd in mess was expected by me.
    <h2><em>Reality</em></h2>
    <div class="pic" align="middle"><img src="mess.jpeg" height="500" width="800">  </div>
    <p>Actually, Our Mess is really good. It has a weekly shedule which is strictly being followed and it has seperate washrooms to for all(Boys and Girls).
        Most of the dishes are good in taste but I personally have issue with the spices they are using in Palak Paneer, otherwise all things are good enough, mess includes all of our breakfast, snacks and meals and also they provide lassi, icecream on weekly basis.And one more good thing is that there are timing slots for every section so that too much crowd could not gather at once. 
    </p> 
    <h1>ABOUT PLACEMENTS</h1>
    <div class="pic" align="middle"><img src="pla.jpg" height="500" width="1100" ></div>
    <p>The good thing about college is that it is one of the fastest growing colleges which had setup its Brand Values and Average <a href="https://www.collegedekho.com/articles/top-btech-colleges-with-100-percent-placements/">Placement</a> Package is getting increased every consecutive year with the highest package also. This is very rare scenario where a very new college grows up this fast specially in terms of placements but afterall this is a IIIT and we can expect it from any IIIT either old or new.</p>
